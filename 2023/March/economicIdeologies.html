    <h1>Democratic and Republican economic ideologies</h1>

    <p>The systems that the Democrats and Republicans advocate for are different. Democrats, as is seen in the literature on their party platform, promote economic assistance to the middle class citizen through government programs. Counterposing that position, Republicans suggest that tax cuts to both the middle class and wealthy people, as well as to corporations, are the smart economic move. Backing up each idea is an economic model, for the Democrats Keynesian economics and for the Republicans supply-side or Smithian economics. For the Democrats, the idea is that greater wealth among the middle classes leads to a greater demand for goods, and the demand spurs on the economy. For the Republicans, the idea is that greater wealth among, especially, the wealthy classes and corporations leads to more innovation in products and hiring in business, and the hiring in turn leads to a boost to the economy. In his book <i>Arguing with Zombies</i>, Krugman suggests that economists are divided between saltwater and freshwater varieties, who correspond roughly with the Democrat and Republican division, and that each side considers the other academically inadequate; to be fair to Krugman, he also suggests that even freshwater economists consider some Republican positions, like trickle down economics, utterly foolish, ideas that are backed only by hacks at think tanks. Overall though, both the Democratic and Republican political positions appear to have some academic backing.</p>
    <p>A Google search for whether Democratic or Republican presidential administrations have better economies, returns results that suggest Democratic presidents tend to have better growing economies: A New York Times op-ed, published in 2021, suggests that since 1933, Democratic presidents have had economies that grow at an average rate of 4.6 percent while Republican presidents have had economies that grow at an average rate of 2.4 percent. The basic arguments of the Democrats and Republicans also seem to favor the Democratic side whenever supply-side economics is called into question: Though even Krugman notes that Republican economists thought that Smithian economics had proven the logic of the free market in the latter half of the twentieth century, nonetheless, the Great Recession indicates that government spending and supply-side economics becomes important whenever markets fail, and markets tend to fail because of malinvestment. A more nuanced approach that combines both the Smithian and the Keynesian approaches might note that the Smithian lens is competent for working markets and the Keynesian one appropriate for the situations of market failure.</p>
    <p>The talking points of the two parties do not reflect the nuanced, combined approach, even if economists like Paul Krugman – who once suggested that three-fourths of the Smithian ideology makes sense – do. The Democrats want to build the middle class, and the Republicans want to cut taxes especially for the wealthy: Both parties claim that they pursue these economic policies in favor of working class citizens. For working class citizens, most of whom do not hold a college degree, not least in economics, the ability to parse the academic debate is probably a moot point. Therefore, the talking points of the Democrats claim to build the middle class and those of the Republicans claim to do the same through tax cuts.</p>
    <p>As I noted in a previous blog post, much of the voting population does so on the basis of social issues rather than economic issues. So when Republicans cut taxes for citizens, including wealthy citizens and also for corporations, the case of ideology with a negative connotation is easy to make because most of the population that voted for representatives who pushed legislation with those tax cuts, did so while thinking about social issues rather than economic issues. For Democrats who raise taxes on the middle and wealthy classes, the claim of ideology with a negative connotation is more difficult to make, even if voters also voted for social reasons because wealth is taken from the wealthy and put into programs for the middle and lower classes.</p>
    <p>Because the claim of ideology with a negative connotation is so easily ridiculed, as a coda, I would note the recent case made against Fox News by Dominion: Next month, a trial is set whereby Dominion is suing Fox News for 1.6 billion dollars for defamation. In recent weeks, news outlets like National Public Radio, CNN, and MSNBC have noted the case because during depositions of the people involved and in discovery, materials have arisen that show the owner and anchors of popular Fox News programs, like Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, and Sean Hannity, promulgated the popular election denial idea while they inwardly among themselves admitted that there was no truth to the idea. Even during the broadcast of the hypocrisy, the Fox News channel continues the election denial claims. Although the example does not have to do with economics, the example does show the degree of ideological manipulation that is active within the Republican Party and their mainstream news outlet.</p>
    <p>When House Speaker Kevin McCarthy claims that the 2023 Biden budget enhances government to the largest it has ever been, although the claim may be true, one cannot help but think that the emotional claim the Speaker of the House is making to an audience has been taught to dislike large government in principle without specifying why the government programs are harmful. Similarly, when former President Trump claims that he is the retribution of the Republican Party for all those who have been betrayed while Tucker Carlson repeats that the election denial is a betrayal of the American public, one cannot but sense the emotional tuning of an audience without rational reflection on the false claims.</p> 
    <p class = "lastParagraph">The Democrats seem not to play as many ideological games as the Republicans. And the Democratic economic system seems to grow the economy more than does the Republican system. Therefore even if the Democrats want to raise taxes on the ultra wealthy in order to pay for social programs for the poor, a move that is ethically dubious since the ultra wealthy work for their share of income, the idea is easier to accept when one is part of the middle and lower classes, especially since the extra taxes on the ultra wealthy barely alters their lifestyle.</p>
