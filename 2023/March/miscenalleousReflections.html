    <h1>Miscellaneous Reflections: center-left democrat; Russian status quo; Google Project Management Certificate; standardized tests and work</h1>

    <p>Some topics I have considered in previous blog posts include the following: cutting taxes for the wealthy fails to trickle down in the economy; a more progressive tax on the wealthy might be economically sound but has difficult moral implications because often the wealthy are intelligent and hard-working; and the consumer price index has risen but middle class wages have stagnated. Another consideration is that the US poverty rate is around 13%, so there is an argument that impoverished people are working jobs whose wages are unable to meet the costs of living; governmental intervention through welfare programs might make sense in those cases. It appears that my thinking about these issues makes me an economic conservative because I am for markets deciding wages rather than for governmental redistribution of wealth through a more progressive tax. Even still, I believe that people should know the facts of the wealth and income distribution of the US because greater inequality might slow national economic growth, and raising the issue of inequality makes me feel like a far left progressive though instead the knowledge makes one an informed citizen: Knowing about the economic structure, a citizen then can make a decision that supports economic conservatives. In terms of theory, I follow Paul Krugman as a neo-Keynesian and believe that markets need governmental regulation. On most social issues, I agree with the Democrats, and there is room in the Democratic Party for economic conservatism, so I will continue to support the Democratic Party as a center-left or moderate democrat.</p>
    <p>Last week marked the one year anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The news was full of stories about the perceptions of Ukranians and Russians. One of the more interesting aspects of the reporting was on the state of discourse in Russia about the war. The state media, which some two-thirds of Russian citizens use for their primary news source, has bellicose ideas and continually accuses the Ukrainians of being a neo-Nazi society that oppresses the Russian speaking population of Ukraine. The citizens that watch such media are also denouncing one another to state officials; the denunciations lead to arrests for being against the state. Students, teachers, coworkers, neighbors, and most other social relations are now fraught with the potential of denunciation. Because there is no freedom of speech, most Russian citizens publicly support the war effort, but there are reports of people privately opposing the effort and lamenting the oppression of the Russian state despite their public facade. Even with the oppression, there is a strong anti-western sentiment that pervades the citizens of Russia who feel in competition with the West; they do so while recognizing the difference between the West and Russia in terms of freedom. Such chauvinistic compartmentalization strikes me as peculiar.</p>
    <p>I recently obtained Google’s Project Management Certificate after completing a course on Coursera. Google’s Senior Vice President for Global Affairs Kent Walker tweeted that Google will treat the certificate as an equivalent of a four year degree. The program focused on the project life cycle – initiation, planning, execution, and completion – and the role that a project manager plays during the life cycle in order to maintain the scope, schedule, and budget of a project. There were six courses in the program, and each course had four to five quizzes and a dozen or more practice quizzes; the quizzes made the program difficult but fair. A student is able to retake a quiz up to three times per twenty-four hours, so there is no fear of failing out of the program, and the quizzes make one pay attention to the material, which consists of both videos and readings. Now that I have a certificate in project management, I am looking for an internship in project management so that I can gain experience and then move into working full time after the internship. Google suggests that the average salary for a project manager is $73,000 per year. I am hoping to find an internship in San Diego, California, where I will move once I find full time employment. I look forward to spending time at the beaches.</p> 
    <p class = "lastParagraph">I have been thinking about the Graduate Record Examinations. In terms of English comprehension, the test assesses verbal reasoning and analytical writing. The assessment is of a functional ability: There are no questions about the grammar of the language, but there are questions about the definitions of vocabulary of higher registers. In order to prepare for the test, a student learns the vocabulary and uses the knowledge during reading passages and questions and also during the composition of essays for the section of analytical writing. I have mixed feelings about the sophisticated vocabulary. Often there are synonyms that are more accessible -- I tend to use the more accessible terms -- and there are many adjectives for character flaws, which I find less useful than abstract nouns that define ideas; at the same time, some words are usefully succinct like compendious and cogent, and also they limn a literary style that is esteemable. The ability to read and comprehend paragraphs of information is a precise and accurate measurement of the ability of a student to engage with a text. Although the test helped me find admittance in graduate school, the test has not been as helpful on the job market. Employers care less about the score than they do about relevant work experience, the gold standard for applications. But because the test assesses functional reading and writing ability, rather than abstract knowledge of the English language, therefore the skills a student demonstrates are relevant for entrance into the workplace. While thinking about the GRE, I read about the Chinese imperial examination (<i>keju</i> in Chinese). The imperial examination was and somewhat still is used to assess applicants for the governmental bureaucracy. Based more on knowledge of the classics than on reading and writing comprehension, the imperial examination was instead a test of knowledge rather than ability, and the test was recognized by the state as a positive quality on an application for work. Anyway, verbal reasoning and analytical writing will be useful skills to have as a project manager while maintaining a schedule, scope, and budget and in communication with team members about the progress of a project. If I ever have hiring power, I will consider standardized tests as an indication of the caliber of an applicant.</p>
