    <h1>On the United States</h1>

    <p>The United States is exceptional, and the claim is grounded in historical fact. The US is the oldest, democratic nation-state in the world: The American revolutionaries were the first to implement ideas of the Enlightenment in a political movement which led to the creation of a national constitution. The connection between the Enlightenment and the American, revolutionary ideology is clear, for example, in phrases of the Declaration of Independence (1776) such as “... all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness,” which echoes <i>The Second Treatise of Government</i> (1689) by John Locke who writes, “Man being born … with a title to perfect freedom, and an uncontrolled enjoyment of all the rights and privileges of the laws of nature, equally with any other man … not only to preserve his property, that is, his life, liberty, and estate …” Although Locke was a predecessor of the Enlightenment, he was an influence on the Enlightenment and might be thought of as an intellectual of the Enlightenment. Another Lockean idea is demonstrated when Jefferson writes that the Americans should dissolve political ties with the British monarch because the latter has infringed on the basic rights of the Americans.</p>
    <p>One can see the influence of other Enlightenment thinkers on the American revolutionaries. Charles Montesquieu, in <i>Spirit of the Laws</i> (1748), wrote of the separation of the legislature, judiciary, and executive, which is the central theme of the Constitution of the US (1787). The Federalist Papers (1787 - 1788), and especially Federalist No. 10, can be seen as a response to <i>The Social Contract</i> (1762) by Jean-Jacques Rousseau: The idea of Federalist Papers and Federalist No. 10 is that a large republic has enough power to accomplish diplomacy and management of its states while at the same time withstanding the vicissitudes of factionalism, and Rousseau argues for direct democracy on moral grounds, which, in the view of Madison, might lead to deleterious factionalism. A final comparison between the Enlightenment and the American, revolutionary ideology is the US Bill of Rights which was an idea borrowed from the English Bill of Rights of 1689; the English Bill of Rights was a consequence of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 - 1689 during which the Parliament of England asserted itself over the monarchy, an early example of Enlightenment thought. Interestingly, the parliamentarians extended the rights neither to minorities nor to the American colonists, just as the American colonists failed to extend the rights of equality and liberty to minorities in the nascent nation. Both the Glorious Revolution and the American Revolution therefore might be interpreted as Enlightenment movements in which class consciousness enabled a repressed group to gain the political achievements of liberty and equality, and only later did they extend those achievements to minorities after subsequent political movements.</p>
    <p>The reason for drawing parallels between the Enlightenment and the American, revolutionary ideology is not to suggest that the latter is derivative but instead to situate the revolution in a panoply of historical developments during which the idea of a symbiosis between natural law and governance drove political mobilization and secondarily to show that the combination was an extension of the scientific revolution more generally during which <b>intellectuals began to consider the universe as governed by natural law which could be discovered and interpreted by man when man used reason to contemplate existence and thereby progress civilization</b>. The American revolutionaries might not have drawn such direct parallels themselves, such as between just governance and the laws of motion of planets and smaller objects, which were discovered by Isaac Newton toward the end of the seventeenth century, but the historical context demonstrates the connection. As such, the American revolution with the Declaration of Independence and the later creation of the Constitution were Enlightenment projects whose actions were then unprecedented and whose common ideology continues to support the national government today. The example has been so persuasive that after imperialism, many former empires and their colonies have adopted a democratic constitution on the American, or at least Enlightenment, model.</p>
    <p>If the American state is democratic, is the government best described as a democracy or a republic? As an undergraduate at The University of Texas at Austin, during a test for a US government course, I answered the question with the answer of democracy. The instructor marked the answer as incorrect. My impression is that because of the fact that the authors of the Federalist Papers used the term democracy to refer to direct democracy, most government oriented people believe that the US is a republic. In classical Rome, the senators of the republic were chosen by censors and not the people, just as in classical Greece, the democracy was a direct democracy: Neither perfectly parallels the US system. The more specific term representative democracy is synonymous with republic in the modern sense, and today I can find no definitive answer about whether the US is officially a representative democracy or a republic: The debate is settled neither by the Constitution nor by any other official document that I have seen. During the last few years, Republican congresspeople have started asking the same question on Twitter and answering that the US is a republic, but, again, I have seen no evidence for their claim other than the assertion that a democracy refers to a direct democracy instead of a representative democracy.</p>
    <p>Most of the political discourse today focuses neither on the connections between the Enlightenment and the founding documents of the nation nor on the question of whether the nation is a democracy or a republic and instead focuses on political issues that are settled according to the processes outlined by the Enlightenment ideology and republic as the two exist in their contemporary forms. A truly informed political opinion would take into account multiple aspects of a discourse including the facts that contextualize an issue, the laws which govern the issue, the ideologies of the political parties which debate an issue, and the popular opinions which inform the stances that politicians take during elections. The next section of this blog post is an amalgamation of various pieces of information concerning the political topics that are important to citizens today.</p>
    <p>On the economy: The US gross domestic product is 23.3 trillion dollars, and the global GDP is 96.5 trillion dollars. This is another way that the US is exceptional: The US has the largest economy of any nation in the world. Services constitute 80% of the US economy, industry constitutes 19% of the economy, and the rest is in agriculture. The federal budget in 2021 had 6.8 trillion dollars in outlays, mostly going to social security, tax credits, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment, and defense spending, and the budget had revenues of 4 trillion dollars from income, payroll, and corporate taxes. In 2022, the deficit fell to 1.4 trillion dollars. Also, during the first two years of the Biden administration, legislation was passed that will make a significant contribution to the economy and especially infrastructure: The American Rescue Plan Act invests 1.9 trillion dollars, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act invests 1.2 trillion, and the Inflation Reduction Act invests 629 billion dollars into the economy. The US makes 256.6 billion dollars in exports and spends 334.8 billion dollars on imports. In January 2023, headline inflation was down to 6.5%; the highest the inflation rate had been in the recent past was 9% in June of 2022.</p>
    <p>On immigration: The legislation that governs immigration is the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. According to the law, each year the US grants 675,000 permanent immigrant visas. No limit is given for the number of visas given to family members under the age of 21. And various limits are given for the number of refugees seeking asylum in the US. There were 2.76 million migrant border crossings in 2022. An estimated 10.5 million immigrants are living without documentation in the US, and there are about 34.6 million authorized immigrants living in the US.</p>
    <p>On abortion: 62% of adults believe that abortion should be legal, and 36% believe abortion should be illegal. There were 930,000 abortions in 2020. Abortion is banned in Texas except for life threatening emergencies.</p>
    <p>On gun control: 40% of adults live in a household with a gun, and 30% of adults own a gun. Of the gun owners, 63% say they own a gun for personal protection. 48% of adults believe that gun violence is a big problem. 53% of adults favor stricter gun laws. In 2020, 45% of people died from gun related injuries: 54% of them were suicides and 43% were murders. 79% of murders involved a firearm. Texas has permissive gun laws.</p>
    <p>On health care: The Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010 and was aimed at providing healthcare to all Americans. In 2020, 8.6% of people had no health insurance. Of the people with health insurance, 66.5% of people had private coverage and 34.8% had public coverage.</p>
    <p>On Supreme Court appointees: In 2022, of the nine Supreme Court justices, six were appointed by a Republican president and three were appointed by a Democratic president.</p>
    <p>On energy consumption by source: 36% petroleum, 32% natural gas, 12% renewables, 11% coal, and 8% nuclear. Of the renewable sources, 40% is biomass, 27% wind, 19% hydroelectric, 12% solar, and 2% geothermal.</p>
    <p>On foreign policy: As of 2015, the US had 800 international military bases which cost 100 million a year to maintain. There are 173,000 troops deployed in 159 countries. 38 billion dollars was spent in foreign aid in 2021.</p>
    <p>On tax brackets (approximations): 37% for over 500 thousand dollars, 35% for over 200 thousand, 32% for over 170 thousand, 24% for over 89 thousand, 22% for over 41 thousand, 12% for over 10 thousand, and 10% for 10 thousand dollars or less.</p>
    <p class = "lastParagraph">In conclusion, the US has a unique history whose founding ideology was part of a historical movement for rationality; today, the system governs politics which has contentious issues like gun control and abortion. The basic information about some political topics limns the complexity of US politics.</p>
