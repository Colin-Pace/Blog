    <h1>A history of the natural sciences</h1>

    <p>In the early modern era, starting with Galileo Galilei and lasting until the present, a shift took place in the fundamental worldview of intellectuals away from the millennia old, irrational explanation of the universe as governed by the sentiments of an interventionist deity and toward a rational one as governed by natural law. Of the many consequences of the shift in mindset on civilization – capitalism and democratic nationalism are examples – science gained an explanatory power that redefined the concepts of the universe and humanity. After centuries of discoveries, today the Big Bang theory and the theory of evolution are the most logical descriptions of the creation of the cosmos and people.</p>
    <p>The Big Bang theory states that the universe began in a small point of energy 13.7 billion years ago and since has expanded and developed and now contains galaxies; the theory is evidenced by Hubble’s law, discovered in 1929, of the expansion of the universal horizon and by the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, discovered in 1964, which was left over from early expansion. Evolution states that generations of life display mutations, some of which confer an advantage in the reproduction of a species thereby becoming more prevalent in successive generations, and the theory is evidenced by the fossil record, which shows a trail of morphological developments from early primates and toward anatomically modern humans; by the skeletal resemblances among the primates; by the gills that embryos have, which date back to the common ancestor of humans and aquatic life, and the vestigial tailbone; by the biogeography of the fossil record, which demonstrates the continuity of similar morphologies; and by similarities in DNA among the primates.</p>
    <p>Stringing the pieces together, a person can trace the evolution of humans from the earliest life forms on the planet: Microbes left impressions on rocks 3.7 billion years ago that fossilized and existed until today; tetrapods emerged from the seas and initiated land dwelling animals 400 million years ago; primates developed from other land animals 85 million years ago; the genus homo evolved from the other primates 2 million years ago; the Omo I fossils, the oldest extant remains of anatomically modern humans, were buried 230,000 years ago; and finally, humans left Africa and inhabited other continents 200,000 years ago. Altogether, 8,000 generations of humans have existed from the start of the species until today. The microbes gave rise not only to humans but some estimated 8 million other species that are alive today, and to countless other species that have lived but are now extinct – 99% of species that have existed are now extinct. Despite the clear evidence and cogency of the theory, today only 65% of adults in the US believe in evolution, while 31% of adults say the present form of life has existed since the beginning of time.</p>
    <p>The Big Bang theory and the theory of evolution are only scientific theories, not laws. One of the important differences between a theory and a law is experimentation. If a hypothesis can be tested during an experiment, and if the hypothesis yields the same results over and over, then the explanation of the hypothesis can become a law or a description of a natural process that governs some aspect of existence. The laws of gravity and of the conservation of mass and energy are examples. A theory by contrast contains a hypothesis that cannot be tested; nonetheless, the theory explains a circumstance of evidence that seems likely. This key distinction differentiates natural and social sciences, as the latter is often unable to create experiments with dependent variables in the way that physics and chemistry can, and the difference has led to contemporary debates about whether the social sciences should be considered science. The theories of the Big Bang and evolution are therefore the best explanations that science can give about the universe and humanity even without experimentation.</p>
    <p>Like Greco-Latin neologisms in English – 60% of the words in English are borrowed from Greek or Latin, and the percentage rises to 90% for the register of science – the modern worldview of science for many citizens is unmarked or appears normal and familiar in textbooks and as descriptions of the cosmos: Another example of an unmarked aspect of science in the modern worldview is the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, which was introduced to Europe and then the US by Fibonacci in the book <i>The Book of Calculation</i> in 1202. A crucial aspect of modern science is the scientific method. The scientific method is a process of experimentation and refining of a theory, which is accomplished by the collection of greater evidence and the sharpening of the precision of a theory.</p>
    <p>The scientific method was introduced to science by Francis Bacon and Isaac Newton in the seventeenth century. In the book <i>The New Instrument</i> (1620), which supposedly updated The Instrument of Aristotle and which was published in the fourth century before the common era, Bacon discusses the scientific method according to the process of induction. A discovery of first principles by experimentation, induction then is generalized to axioms, according to Bacon, and the axioms are further clarified by observation and experiment, thereby avoiding the unfactual generalizations that lengthy syllogism delivers. The method of Bacon can be summarized as induction giving rise to deduction which is then checked by further induction. In <i>Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy</i> (1687), Newton gives four rules of reasoning in philosophy, which were his contribution to the nascent scientific method. The four rules might be summarized accordingly: true and sufficient explanations are given for causes; the same causes have the same effects; universal qualities are deduced from experimentation; and propositions are accurate until more evidence demonstrates otherwise. As forays into the scientific method, the ideas offered by Bacon and Newton were of gigantic importance though neither called their suggestions the scientific method – the term was first used in 1672 – nor is either well developed in comparison to the descriptions of the scientific method that are given in textbooks today.</p>
    <p>Around the time that Bacon and Newton were limning the scientific method, the advent of the modern sciences also was forming. The following is a list of founders of the modern disciplines: Newton himself created physics in 1687 with <i>Mathematical Principles</i> in which he described the laws of motion and gravity; Antoine Lavoisier started chemistry by theorizing the elements and the law of conservation of mass in the work <i>Elementary Treatise on Chemistry</i> (1789); Charles Darwin discovered the central theory of biology in evolution in the work <i>On the Origin of Species</i> (1859); James Hutton proposed uniformitarianism, or the idea that processes acting over long time spans account for the present and past geological features, in the work <i>Theory of Earth</i> (1788) and began geology; and Galileo Galilei proved an astronomy with the idea of heliocentrism, or the idea that the Sun is at the center of the Solar System, promoted theoretically first by Copernicus in 1543, in Galileo's work <i>The Starry Messenger</i> (1610). These foundational thinkers and their works mark the start of the modern disciplines of science though they are often not the pioneers who discovered the objects of the modern disciplines: Dalton discovered evidence of the atom in 1808; Perrin discovered the molecule in 1926; and Hooke discovered the cell in 1665 – the objects of the disciplines of physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively. Nonetheless, for a heuristic description of the modern sciences, Newton, Lavoisier, Darwin, Hutton, and Galileo are good representatives of the founders.</p>
    <p>Since the early formation of the disciplines, major breakthroughs have given rise to new conceptions of the sciences: in 1905, Albert Einstein gave rise to quantum mechanics with his research into the photoelectric effect, and the Standard Model of particle physics and the forces that govern them was formalized in the 1970s: the Higgs boson was discovered in 2012; Mendeleev offered the Periodic Table of Elements in 1869, and Oganesson was discovered in 2002; the Modern Synthesis, the term which describes the fusion of Darwinian evolution and Mendelian genetics, was coined in 1942, the DNA double helix was discovered in 1953, and the Human Genome Project continued to near the end of sequencing the human genome in 2022; Edwin Hubble discovered other galaxies in 1924, and he learned of the expansion of the universal horizon by observations made in 1929. The additions to the disciplines of natural science – physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and astronomy – can be interpreted according to the ideas of Thomas Kuhn who in <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i> (1962) theorized that scientific disciplines conduct normal science and in doing so make discoveries that accrete and build up over time; then after a discipline has accumulated multiple accretions, some breakthrough redefines the discipline so entirely, by bringing into focus and explaining the accretions, that the discipline is revolutionized.</p>
    <p>The early modern thinkers mentioned above who initiated the disciplines can be thought of as such revolutionaries. Further evidence of the impact the time period is the fact that many of the disciplines began to redefine the words ascribed to them: The first known use of physics in the modern sense was in 1715, chemistry in 1646, biology in 1799, geology in 1735, and astronomy in the 12th century. A development like quantum mechanics, which stands with classical mechanics as the two pillars of modern physics, can be interpreted as an accretion to the discipline of physics. Mathematics, a discipline on which the other sciences so heavily rely, might be considered a sixth natural science. Algebra was invented by Muhammad Khwarizmi in 830 of the Common Era and takes its name from part of the title of the work it was published in: The form of the algebra of Khwarizmi was largely written in prose, and not until 1591, in <i>Introduction to the Art of Analysis</i> by Francois Viete, did algebra gain a symbolic form. Newton invented calculus in <i>Mathematical Principles</i>. The modern notion of mathematics, a science of numbers, is first attested in 1573.</p>
    <p>The scientific revolution followed an earlier cultural efflorescence, the Renaissance. During the Renaissance, classical texts were rediscovered and reinterpreted by European intellectuals, and the cognoscenti of the Renaissance were particularly influenced by Plato and Aristotle who opened schools in the fourth century BCE and taught, among other things, natural philosophy. Aristotle, in particular, commented on the objects of all the modern sciences: His lecture notes contain discourse on motion, the elements as he knew them, organisms and their generation, the Earth, and the cosmos. In retrospect, the theories are almost completely incorrect and the information is blunt and outdated, and there was no scientific method or commentary about the process of the collection and reflection on facts. Nonetheless, the categories are there in Aristotle, and his early explorations into knowledge collection and formation was instrumental to the later thinkers of the early modern era, at least as an example of a type of science which could be improved upon by greater and more precise induction and deduction. It is worth noting that the early universities – Oxford and Cambridge were founded in the 13th century, and the word university has its first known use in the 14th century – taught Aristotelian science, which later thinkers like Newton learned and reacted to. In many ways, Aristotle was the first scientist.</p>
    <p>Today, the natural sciences are taught at university according to the disciplines that formed out of natural philosophy in the early modern era: Universities have departments of physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and astronomy. A recent trend is a combination of the disciplines to target some more specific aspect of them, and biochemistry and astrophysics are examples. The multidisciplinary titles are also common for descriptions of employment and journal topics; often they are collected and categorized according to whether the discipline is a physical, life, or Earth science. Overall, there is no one institution that defines what the sciences are; instead there are multiple institutions with various influences that set trends among the disciplines.</p>
    <p>One of the popular science magazines today is <i>Nature</i>. In an article published at the end of 2022 about the science of 2023, the topics of moon landings, mRNA vaccines, and climate finance are listed as some of the most relevant scientific discussions for the new year. The Artemis mission of NASA has the goal of reestablishing a human presence on the Moon. Part of the objective is to build a Lunar Gateway, a space station that will orbit the Moon, so that humans will have an extraplanetary base from which to launch scientific missions on the Moon and further beyond. The closest star to the Sun is Proxima Centauri, and the star has an exoplanet in its orbit known as Proxima Centauri b. The exoplanet is in the habitable zone, so scientists are interested in the exoplanet as a place for human exploration. Yet a problem of distance remains: The Proxima Centauri system is 4.2 light years away from Earth, a distance which would take a spacecraft like Voyager 73,000 years to traverse. The Lunar Gateway is a gateway to the Solar System, at least for the near future until better technology is created. Engineering, like bioengineering, can be considered an applied science. The use of mRNA vaccines is an integral method of medicine today. The messenger RNA catalyzes an immune response in the body by delivering an RNA which encodes an antigen to cells which then build the foreign protein; the reaction of the body to the foreign protein teaches the body to recognize and destroy the pathogen. Many of the popular vaccines for coronavirus are mRNA vaccines. As for climate finance, it was established in November 2022 at the United Nations COP27, a climate change conference, that a loss and damage fund would be set up whereby wealthy countries with high carbon emissions will pay poorer countries which are more affected by the extreme weather events. Many of the poorer countries are in the global south and are former colonies of the previously imperial and currently wealthier countries which are less affected by climate change: The post colonial dynamic of climate change adds further tension to the development of science around the globe because anti colonialism often involved the dismissal of western culture in favor of a more authentic national culture. Yet many of the former colonies adopted democratic nationalism and scientific institutions on the western model.</p>
    <p class = 'lastParagraph'>Despite the great progress in science since its emergence in the early modern era, there are still aspects of the universe that remain unexplained today. Research into these topics includes, for example, the nature of dark matter and dark energy and that of consciousness. Rather than look at the fact that a majority of matter and energy in the universe are dark matter and dark energy, though science knows very little about the phenomena, as failures of science, instead the topics might be conceived as new frontiers of exploration and discovery. Because of the malleable nature of science and the structure of scientific revolutions, therefore, the collection of information about dark matter, dark energy, and consciousness and the reflection about them might yield theoretical discoveries that reshape the ways that humans understand the universe and our place in it, another great plateau in the ascent of humanity into the cosmos.</p>
