    <h1>Modern ideologies: democracy, capitalism, and scientific multiculturalism</h1>

    <p>In my experience, people tend to believe in the political, economic, and cultural systems into which they are born. That is the reason why systems tend to have geographic continuity. The very fact of geographic continuity should spark reflection on behalf of people who adhere to the institutions of their locality, but often it does not, and even vigorous debate about the pros and cons of various systems fails to sway opinion away from local, hegemonic forms.</p>
    <p>In writing this blog, I realize that I myself am promoting the political, economic, and cultural systems of the nation in which I was born: democracy, capitalism, and scientific multiculturalism. Despite the fact that there is the appearance of a nativist bias, nonetheless, I believe that democracy, capitalism, and scientific multiculturalism are the best systems in the world because they allow, respectively, freedom and self governance, sustainable growth and prosperity, and rationalism and equality. Not only are they the best systems, in my opinion, but furthermore they can be defended on a rational basis and themselves demand rational reflection and evaluation – further distancing themselves from other systems like authoritarianism, communism, and religious ethnocentrism, which restrict freedoms, impoverish the middle classes, and blind adherents to natural truth and to social equality. The nativist bias in my case withstands objective scrutiny, and I feel justified in promulgating the ideologies.</p>
    <p>Rather than try to persuade the multitudes against their hegemonic indoctrination, especially outside the United States and the western world, but also inside the US and the western nations where many remain sympathetic to authoritarianism and ethnocentrism, because the act of persuasion is so often futile and requires laborious and prolonged exposure to other modes of thought, the method of introducing democracy, capitalism, and scientific multiculturalism to new generations seems like the best way to increase the numbers of people who hold such values. This blog, then, is less of a polemic and more of a paean to the modern ideologies.</p>
    <p class = "lastParagraph">I am finding that once I outline the main ideas and their histories and figures – the Founding Fathers and Abraham Lincoln, John Smith and John Maynard Keynes, and the early scientists and champions of social equality like Martin Luther King Jr. – the majority of the content of the blog is complete, and then I have to find other subjects to write about. I have abstained from writing about even those iconic subjects because they have become cliche due to their fame, and from outlining American and capitalist history due to the redundancy because of the availability of resources like encyclopedias that have more in depth ideas. Nonetheless, I have felt it necessary to mention the ideologies and to highlight aspects of the history that the encyclopedias mention often only in passing: The switch to scientific rationalism from religious traditionalism is a key moment in early modern history, for example. Now, writing about timely aspects of the subjects often feels too inconsequential after discussions of the contours and establishment of the ideologies: Noting this week’s political scandal, inflation rate, scientific discovery of the composition of an area of the Martian soil, and another example of ethnocentrism seems important but uninspired. I want the blog to be more than a documentary of the modern ideologies. I am going to have to think about how to address the lacuna of topics.</p>
