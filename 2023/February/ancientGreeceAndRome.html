    <h1>Ancient Greece and Rome</h1>

    <p>A student of the humanities and sciences, I have a fascination for ancient Greece and Rome because they were foundational civilizations for contemporary western nations. The civilizations pioneered sociocultural forms that are reimagined today. English neologisms of intellectual registers are built on Greco-Latin etymons, the US government is a representative democracy with a Senate, the Supreme Court and other buildings have porticos, Hollywood popularizes drama and comedy, and collectively universities are called the academy. Unlike the modern day sociocultural forms which derive their structure and function from the older ones, the ancient Greco-Latin languages, governments, architectures, performing arts, and schools were originals which makes the societies and cultures of ancient Greece and Rome all the more remarkable. Even if the argument that Rome derived much of its language and culture from Greece is admitted, one cannot help but notice that Rome originated many ideas - not least of which are the notions of humanity and science, <i>humanitas</i> and <i>scientia</i>.</p>
    <p>As a graduate student on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, I studied the ancient languages, but I read the literature in English translation. The ancient languages have a difficult morphology with cases and declension types, and I never became fluent enough in them to read Homer or Virgil in the original. (I prefer analytic to synthetic languages.) But I read them in translation. I also read the entries in <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> for ancient Greece and Rome. I learned that there are multiple approaches to the history of the ancient civilizations: Politics, society, culture, literature, and art are just a few disciplinary approaches.</p>
    <p>In terms of politics, I read about the Greco-Persian Wars and the Peloponnesian Wars; about the conquest of Alexander from Macedon to Egypt and India; and about the Roman conquest of the peninsula with the Punic Wars and then from Britain to Arabia. The wars were brutal, the technology was rudimentary, and the casualties were enormous. More interesting to me than the ancient battles are the governments that emerged in classical Greece and Rome: the direct democracy of Athens and the Senate of Rome. I learned about Cleisthenes’ reforms which led to the Grecian democracy though I never read of such a founding figure for the Roman Senate. Today a Google search for who founded the Roman Senate suggests that the mythical figure of Romulus set it up. The Roman transition from republic to empire is one of the most discussed aspects of the classical world, which happened in the decades before Jesus was born in a Roman province. The empire was astounding for its size, but like with the British empire two millennia later, I do not idealize the Roman empire as a political form because the form of government was unjust. I rather read about the formation of the US Constitution than about Augustus’ reign. In terms of politics, the direct democracy of classical Greece and the Senate of ancient Rome are the two political forms that I admire the most for their innovation without precedent.</p>
    <p>The society and culture of ancient Greece and Rome were also problematic in many ways. Slavery and patriarchy were common in both places. Traditional beliefs about the cosmos were irrationally religious. The cuisine was not vegan. Yet in this otherwise typically ancient milieu, a strand of intellectual thought emerged that later blossomed into the Renaissance, Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment. The pre-Socratic philosophers started the tradition, and Pythagoras is my favorite because of his mathematical theorem which I learned early while at school in Austin. Really, though, Socrates and Plato were the two who elaborated the ideas of rationality into a philosophy through skepticism and deduction. Even if the argument is admitted that Plato had an irrational belief in cosmic forms and built a theory of teleology instead of scientific induction, Plato must be granted the recognition of rationalism for his consideration of the just forms of government and society. If Plato spurred on philosophy, his pupil Aristotle took the discipline to another level by writing volumes of lecture notes about all sorts of topics; Aristotle tried to understand the world in a systematic way through induction and deduction, and he formalized the processes he used to think about subjects in an attempt to solidify both the knowledge he produced and the methods he used to produce it. No author in Rome matches the type of work that Aristotle produced. Virgil wrote an epic, and Cicero wrote speeches and philosophy. Cicero’s work is often credited, along with Isocrates before him, for innovating a new literary style of prose, with clausal embellishments and coined terms, but the content of the work is of a Stoic coming to terms with Stoicism in Rome - he was a humanist and not a scientist.</p>
    <p>To be truthful, I have not read the plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles, or any other Grecian playwright of the time. My knowledge of the theater begins with Shakespeare. But I am familiar with the idea of catharsis, and I know the story of Oedipus. Also I am probably more familiar with Neoclassical art and architecture, from the David to the Supreme Court portico, than I am with the ancient forms - other than the Parthenon. The emotion I associate with viewing the Neoclassical creations, awe and veneration, makes me idealize the classical forms on which the latter forms are based. I am no expert: I know there are types of columns, Doric, Ionian, and some others, but I do not know what sets them apart from each other.</p>
    <p class = "lastParagraph">The fascination I have for ancient Greece and Rome is therefore complex. There is a respect for the originality and innovativeness of aspects of the civilizations while at the same time a disappointment that the civilizations were beset by the maladies of most ancient civilizations: war, inequality, superstition, and others.</p>
