    <title>Negative ideology</title>

    <h1>Negative ideology: a distraction from class structure</h1>

    <p>The neutral definition of ideology is a set of ideas that frame a worldview: I used the term in the neutral sense in the previous blog post when I described the modern American ideology as consisting of democracy, capitalism, and scientific multiculturalism. Ideology often has a negative connotation, in the sense that someone misperceives reality and believes in the misperception, sometimes because someone else intended the misperception. Two popular books complement one another and together represent both sides (the one who creates the misperception and the one who misperceives it) of the negative connotation of ideology: <i>Arguing with Zombies</i> by Paul Krugman makes the case that a network of moneyed cynicism has created the modern GOP platform of small government and tax cuts for the rich, much of which is based on arguments that conservative politicians and thinkers know to be inaccurate and misleading, and <i>What’s the Matter with Kansas</i> by Thomas Frank argues that middle class conservatives vote against their economic interests because the Republican Party incites their passions about social issues while minimizing the effect and truth about economic issues.</p>
    <p>Krugman especially has an impressive reputation, and I am inclined to believe his arguments on the basis of his position as a commentator for the New York Times and public intellectual; when Krugman writes that there is little economic evidence that tax cuts for the wealthy help grow the national economy, his position seems believable even though I have not seen the evidence: A Google search for whether tax cuts for the wealthy helps grow the economy, shows that most notable publications agree with Krugman. Frank has less of a reputation and education than Krugman, and I am less likely to believe his arguments on the basis of his position as a public intellectual. Often Frank makes what I believe are tangential claims about pop culture and the Republican worldview such as the importance to middle American Republicans of feeling inferior to coastal liberal elites.</p>
    <p>Despite my hesitancy about some of his arguments, I am interested in the thesis of Frank’s book, that Republicans vote against their economic interests because of the ideology of the party, and the same argument might be extended to Democrats who could push for a more progressive ideology. The middle class chooses between two parties, neither of which redistribute wealth despite increasing inequality. In the blog post about inequality, I noted that economists tend to agree that increasing inequality might lead to slower national economic growth because money is kept unproductive in savings rather than productive in investments. The economic argument against inequality is joined by a moral argument, which is that there should be a minimum standard of living – with healthcare, for example – for all citizens of the nation. I feel more compelled by the economic argument against inequality than by the moral argument mainly because the US has pathways for people into the middle class even if those pathways are less robust than the social programs of some European nations. The countervailing moral argument against taking money from the wealthy, because often the wealthy are hard-working and smart people who deserve remuneration, nullifies much of the strength of the moral argument for a progressive tax structure in my opinion.</p>
    <p>The phenomenon of ideology with a negative connotation is fascinating. In my experience, people believe in party ideology because of stories that they hear from their elders, and then people sharpen those stories by talking points from the party which aligns them to the party ideology. When faced with stark realities, such as the Great Recession of 2008 when capitalist markets failed due to malinvestment or increasing economic inequality, people either dismiss the facts of the matter or rely on the ideology to assuage the seriousness of the contradiction between ideology and circumstance, between the ideology of <i>laissez-faire</i> and the financial crisis for example. The enormous numbers of people who agree with them, including influential media personalities and political officials, make the compartmentalization that much easier to endure.</p>
    <p>A Google search shows that a few billion dollars are spent each year on lobbying. That money, combined with the networks of think tanks and media outlets that normalize the economic inequality of the system, appear to prop up at least some zombies in the sense that Krugman uses the term, as bad ideas that nonetheless continue to thrive. So there is an element of bad faith in the political system. Furthermore, many voters are probably unaware of the degree of inequality. Many intellectuals, both conservative and liberal, probably justify the economic inequality on moral grounds: why steal from hard-working and successful people? My impression is that <b>rather than a nefarious cabal of cynical money, an almost cartoonish depiction, the billionaires and millionaires of America instead knowingly contribute to a political system that promotes values which most citizens find persuasive and which downplay the degree and importance of class distinction – anyone who raises the issue of a progressive tax is easily ostracized from the mainstream and thereby rendered non threatening politically. To that extent, the negative connotation of ideology is apparent in American politics, in both parties</b>. The overall picture is that voters are largely unaware of the class structure and are enticed by social arguments to propel the status quo. One might argue that most voters are unconcerned with the class structure, which is why they do not know about it. The observation raises the issue of hegemony, in the technical sense: Citizens are raised to be unconcerned with the class structure despite the importance of the structure in their everyday lives, and so citizens do not question the lack of discussion about it in politics.</p>
    <p>The picture is not bleak, however. As Steven Pinker shows in <i>Enlightenment Now</i>, despite the class structure and politics of contemporary American society, overall life is getting longer and better for most people. Pinker attributes the improvement to Enlightenment values of reason, humanism, science, and progress that have become so normalized that they are often not recognized as Enlightenment values but instead as the status quo. It is a happy reminder that living standards in the US are improving despite class conflicts.</p>
    <p>Here are two tables that show, respectively, the income structure and the wealth structure of the modern US class system. There are about 700 billionaires and 20 million millionaires in the US. The top 1% of wealth by household starts around $11 million. </p>
