    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>In this blog, I will write my thoughts about various subjects like science, politics, history, and music. The subjects interest me for their profundity – for example, cell replication and DNA transcription and translation – and for their timeliness: for example, the class structure of the United States by income and education: 35% of citizens make less than 25 thousand dollars per year, 36% make between 25 and 50 thousand, 16% make between 50 and 75 thousand, 6% make between 75 and 100 thousand, and 7% make more than 100 thousand dollars per year; and 86% of citizens have a high school degree, 39% have a bachelor’s, 13% have a master’s, and 2% have a doctorate degree. I collect the statistics from different sources like Pew Research Center and the US Census though I rarely cite the sources, and the statistics inform about the structure and function of societies and cultures and thereby give context for more philosophical questions that have no right or wrong answer like whether the wealthy should be taxed more to pay for basic goods and services in a nation. There are 20 million millionaires and 700 billionaires in the US (and 50 million millionaires and 2,700 billionaires globally), and the poverty rate in the US is 12% or 40 million people: If a progressive tax structure alleviates poverty and does not affect the purchasing power of wealthy people, is the structure more just or does the penalization of success nullify the utilitarian argument? Many of the statistics represent the status quo of a year, and unless the rates adjust rapidly, then I offer the statistics without historical context.</p>
    <p>My background is in the social sciences. I was educated in anthropology and focused on South Asia while in graduate school during the 2010s at The University of Texas at Austin. In terms of civilizations, my more recent interests are in the US and western culture because of the laudable ideology of the Democratic Party in civil liberties, social equality, and a mixed economy and because of technological sophistication and its literature like the Standard Model of particle physics, the Modern Synthesis of evolution and genetics, and the Internet and World Wide Web; and in the ancient cultures of Greece and Rome that set the foundations for the Renaissance, Enlightenment, Industrial Revolution, and modernity. An appreciation for technology and a desire for a more reliable occupation than professorship, led me to learn web development after I left graduate school in the late 2010s. After a few years of self study, I returned to UT Austin to attend the coding bootcamp there and from which I obtained a certificate in 2021. I am currently applying for employment at various places and hope that 2023 will find me employed either as a web developer or as a research analyst or project developer. I also will write about the experience of applying to jobs in this blog.</p>
    <p>In addition to web development, when I left graduate school in the late 2010s, I devoted myself to learn the basics of science: Only 28% of the American public is scientifically literate though maybe that is not bad considering 52% of the public has a reading competence of a sixth grade level or less. I bought and read college textbooks that introduce the subjects of physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and astronomy with their focus on the atom, molecule, cell, planet, and star. I supplemented this curricula by reading the encyclopedia on important topics like the fields of the Standard Model of physics – nuclear, electromagnetic, and gravity – and also by reading other books and articles about important figures like Albert Einstein who discovered quantum mechanics through his work on the photoelectric effect and the general theory of relativity whose idea can be tersely characterized by the aphorism that matter tells spacetime how to curve, and curved spacetime tells matter how to move. The goal I had was to gain scientific literacy and to appreciate the wonders of the literature which was pioneered by people all over the world and especially in the US. Knowledge of the basic scientific paradigms also functions to satisfy questions about life that otherwise are left to irrational systems of knowledge: How did the universe begin and what is humanity? 64% of the nation is Christian, 30% is none, and 6% other, so 100 million people identify similarly irreligiously as I do. Interestingly, 81% of citizens think that government investment in science is good for society even if fewer think that scientific experts should participate in political debates about key issues like climate change and renewable energy.</p>
    <p>Complementing the anthropological focus on the multiculturalism and ethnocentrism of society and culture of different nations, the autocracy and democracy of their governments, and the connections among them which define globalization in the modern age, the university as an institution interests me, and in particular I am interested in UT Austin where I was an undergraduate and graduate student from 2005 until 2017 with a few years off for international travel to France, India, and Burma. UT Austin is a Public Ivy and has a research budget of 670 million dollars per year. The university was ranked 43 globally and 23 nationally in a ranking of universities. UT Austin is one of the largest universities in the world with 40 thousand undergraduate and 10 thousand graduate students and 3,000 faculty on the beautiful campus in downtown Austin. As a student, I had access to excellent faculty and also to a consistent flow of scholars visiting for semesters and also to give talks about their research and their disiciplines. The level of discourse at UT Austin is exceptional, and I am proud of both my degrees from the institution and the abilities of scholarship that I gained while studying there. At UT Austin, I completed 100 undergraduate hours with a 3.7 grade point average and 104 graduate hours with a 3.6 grade point average; I took two degrees, a bachelor’s degree in anthropology and a master’s degree in Asian cultures and languages, and one certificate in coding. I was studious and the effort paid off not least because I was also capable: When I took the Graduate Record Examinations test for entrance into graduate school, I placed in the 96th percentile nationally for the categories both of verbal reasoning and analytical writing. I like to think of intelligence as a precision tool that can be guided toward accuracy through education, and together precision and accuracy, intelligence and education are the pillars that create a well formed citizen who can engage with the discourses of science, politics, and the rest.</p>
    <p>Periodically, I return to the notion of rationality as an important principle. The idea that a worldview is formed by discourse that is based on reason and logic is important to me and inspires me to continue to refine thought when I become lethargic. Although I tend to wish there was a solid, general definition of logic that could be as precise as the syllogism or if-then statements in programming, often for anthropological questions like about the justness of the progressive tax system, no such definition is readily apparent: The most applicable principle of rationality available is that statements should have explanations and the explanations should be relevant and cogent. For example, the utilitarian argument for the progressive income tax system can draw on the poverty and wealth statistics as well as the fact that mega companies rely on societal distribution networks like roadways and police forces, in order to argue for the implementation of greater taxes on the wealthy. The counter argument of the ingenious wealthy being able to invest greater amounts of money in innovative and productive areas, has no easy resolution in a syllogism or other logical structure. Both sides are evidenced and cogent, rational. The choice might then be a preference for the type of development that a person thinks is better for civilization: boom and bust versus progress in smaller increments. I find these types of questions interesting and try to appreciate both sides for the merits and demerits of their arguments. Scientific breakthroughs, unlike capitalist breakthroughs, tend to happen because of a distillation of discourse that enables an individual or small groups to make giant leaps: quantum physics and the Internet are examples. Apple devices are the paradigmatic icon of capitalist innovation though for me personally, capitalist innovation does not persuade me in favor of more Republican viewpoints on the tax system. Like the principle of rationality, that of first principles is an intermittent idea that I have. Made popular by Elon Musk but with a history dating to early modern times in the concept of <i>ab initio</i>, the idea of first principles suggests that knowledge of the fundamentals of a discourse clarifies thought for apt ratiocination devoid of the superfluous and redundant aspects of a discourse that develop with commentary. I like to think of rationality and first principles as lode stars to follow while thinking through discourse or alternatively as ginger for sushi: a momentary spice and revitalization which refocuses on the main subject.</p>
    <p>The literature about CRISPR is another discourse I have followed since leaving graduate school in the late 2010s and which will appear frequently as a subject of reflection in this blog. A technology for genome engineering, CRISPR can activate or interfere with gene expression by making nicks and double strand breaks in the sugar phosphate backbone of a gene. The cleaving nuclease of CRISPR is guided to a genetic locus by a programmed RNA, and homology directed repair and non homologous end joining, achieve the activation and interference with genes. Researchers think that such genome engineering will be able to cure diseases in the near future. I am interested in the structure and function of the technology and of the object of the technology, which is DNA, and also in the societal impacts of the technology: What diseases might be cured – sickle cell anemia and thalassemia are front runners for what might be cured first – and what is ethical are good questions. My research into CRISPR complemented my reading about biology, and in particular interested me in the subjects of how a gamete can, through replication, transcription, and translation, attain the status of a functioning multi celled organism. The coordination among cells through cell signaling for the orchestration of proteins and cellular specialization is remarkable. I also developed questions about the ability of motor proteins to move to the correct locations with various packages in tow. A goal I have this year is to learn more about the organization of cell signaling and motor proteins, in addition to how CRISPR can be used to modify the natural structures and functions.</p>
    <p>Despite the fact that I studied web development and science after graduate school, I still tend to look at the world through the viewpoint of an anthropological lens. Important in this worldview is the nationalization of kingdom states in the early modern era before their interrelations during globalization in contemporary times. The nationalization of states began with the US, and the US Constitution is the oldest constitution in force in the world today. After nationalization, much of which occurred through political movements of decolonization and anti imperialism, today there are 193 member states of the United Nations. 57% of the nations of the world are democratic, 13% autocratic, and 28% mixed: Most of the Americas and Europe have democratic governments while African and Asian nations tend to have mixed governments. The Human Development Index – which measures health, education, and wealth – reports that North American and European nations are very high, while South American, Asian, and African nations are a mix of high, medium, and low. Part of nationalization is a focus on the race of the citizens of a nation. According to modern science, race as a human categorization is a social construct, an idea that has no scientific definition but has gained salience due to the usage of the term by groups to delimit one another socially. In fact, humans are 99.9% the same in terms of their DNA, and the 0.1% that varies among them does so more within a race, at 96%, than DNA varies between races. Another sign that race is a social construct rather than a biological, taxonomic category is the fact that the US Census enables people to self identify their race. Even though race is a social construct, because many people believe the category to have a biological basis, therefore the idea continues to have cache in US politics. Not only that, but because race is a category according to which discrimination has taken place historically in the form of racism, therefore race is a useful category by which to ameliorate discrimination in order to achieve parity among people today. A difficulty of the continuation of the idea, however, is that most people without a college education in the liberal arts that deconstructs race and posits the concept as a social construct, tend to believe that race is a valid biological category and continue to identify by race as if it were dictated by their genomes. These are the merits and demerits of the politics of race today though the science is clear that the concept is a social construct.</p>
    <p>If anthropology looks at the world in terms of nations and the groups that make up the nations, the discipline has a set of basic vocabulary that helps specify the milieu. For example, the distinction between society and culture recognizes the types of social relations that a nation has, whether kinship, political, or economic (such as brothers, fellow citizens, or coworkers), and the beliefs and practices that people of those societies hold and perform. For me, the most interesting application of these distinctions is to scientists and progressive Democrats in the US. 1.5% or 5 million people are employed as scientists or engineers in the US, and that the scientific method and experimentation for the elucidation of knowledge and the creation of technology are the beliefs and practices of the group; and that about 46% of citizens are Democrats and believe in the Democratic ideology: Notably, about 140 million people live in a state with total Democratic governance. A standard anthropological analysis then looks at cases of social relations, beliefs, and practices, and evaluates them according to their degree of multiculturalism and ethnocentrism and also autocracy and democracy. The US is multicultural with more than 50 million international migrants, the most of any nation: 3.6% of people globally are international migrants. The Democratic ideology of social equality appraises all cultures as equal if different, and many of the interesting vicissitudes of history can be found in the development of different societies and cultures. Also despite the recent trends in autocratic governance during the Trump administration, exemplified most poignantly by the January 6th insurrection, the US remains democratic in its foundational institutions: Though it is worth noting that in 2022, 47% of Republican candidates were presidential election deniers: These challenges shook, but did not dismantle, American democracy.</p>
    <p>In many ways, climate change in the Anthropocene is the most relevant issue of the confluence of science and anthropology. Caused by carbon dioxide and methane gasses, which are emitted by machinery and which trap solar radiation from Earth’s crust and cause temperatures to rise and the consequent weather intensification, climate change affects all nations although differently: The poorest nations often are the least responsible for emissions and the most affected by extreme weather events. 75% of US citizens believe in climate change, and 67% of citizens believe that the government is doing too little to slow the process. In his first days in office, President Biden rejoined the Paris Agreement: an agreement among 193 UN nations to keep the rise in temperature below 2 degrees Celsius or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Whether clean energy will be able to displace fossil fuels as a cheap and abundant source in time to cut global emissions so that the Paris Agreement can be reached, is a cutting edge political question. 12.4% of US energy consumption is generated by renewable energy: A drastic increase will be necessary in order to achieve the emissions which would satisfy the Paris Agreement.</p>
    <p class = "lastParagraph">In summary, this blog will be an assortment of posts about various topics that have profound and timely importance. The blog will be a space where I can write and reflect on the issues and a demonstration of an intelligent and educated, subtle and truthful discussion for citizens: a space to utilize the education I gained at UT Austin and to create a discourse around subjects that interest me. Each post will be between 5 to 10 paragraphs and 1,000 to 3,000 words long. Unlike this blog post, which is an overview of the types of topics that I will post about, most posts will be about one or two subjects. I will try to publish weekly. I am excited about doing research during the first part of a week and then writing the blog during the second half of a week.</p>
